**TLDR**: I'm using `HPI`(Human Programming Interface) package as a means of unifying, accessing and interacting with all of my personal data.

It's a Python library (named `my`), a collection of modules for various services that I use. You can find other HPI modules from the community that will all play well together.

[_Why?_](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI#why)

This is built on top of and uses lots of the machinery from [`karlicoss/HPI`](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI)

### My Modules

- `my.activitywatch` - computer activity tracker so I know how I am spending my time
- `my.eightsleep` - sleep tracking & temperature regulation with lots of other data goodies
- `my.levelshealth` - continious glucose monitor
- `my.todoist` - TODO list
- `my.typeform` - used for pre-sleep quiz & weekly quiz
- `my.withings` - activity tracker
- `my.taskwarrior` - another TODO list
